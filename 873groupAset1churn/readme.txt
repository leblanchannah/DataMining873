A telecommunications company finds that some of its customers leave
for other providers. They would like to understand if those who
leave ('churn') have particular properties, for two reasons: they

they may be able to offer customers who are about to leave some
kind of sweetener that will entice them to stay.

Your mission is to help develop this understanding using your allocated
technique.
